# Hangman-Game
### Description:
This project is part of [The Odin Projects](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/ruby-hangman) in Ruby curriculum.

This Hangman game selects a word between 5-12 letters long from a text file. On each turn, you can guess one letter. To win, you must find all the letters in the word before using 10 incorrect guesses.

In addition, you may choose to save a game. It will be saved as a "saved_game.yaml" file. At the beginning of each game, you can choose to load a previously saved game or start a new one. Also, at the start of each round, you can save your game. When you lose or wing (finish your game) you have the choice to delete your saved game.

### Run the code:
- you just need to install the files and run `ruby hangman.rb`.

Note: make sure the files are in the same directory.
